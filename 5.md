# Customizing deployments
Certain situations exist especially in multicluster scenarios and in development workflows where an application requires specific values to be unique for that environment.
*Kustomize* was created to handle that specific situation and as of Kubernetes 1.14 the functionality is integrated into `kubectl`.

## Creating a Kustomized App
This lab is going to walk through the details of deploying a project and resources that use the same YAML files but are unique per cluster based on values provided by *Kustomize*.


The [lab-5-assets](./lab-5-assets/base) contains definitions to deploy these resources.
